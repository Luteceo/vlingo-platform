## Maintaining the Libraries

### Synchronizing Library Versions

- see [build.gradle](build.gradle) for the list of repos, versions and replacement regexes
- adjust the config
- if the directories are checked out already next to this repo, make sure, the right branches (`master`) are checked out, and all changes are committed
- run `gradle` or `./gradlew`
- alternatively, run `gradle syncVersions` without checking out automatically
- review and commit the repos
